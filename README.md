Hello, My Name is Collin!
Feel free to check out my projects!

-ODriveSystem
This project used an O-Drive Controller to run an automated linear actuating system for sensor calibration. The code is used to run tests and run the calibration procedure

-Instrumentation Report Builder
This project used raw CAN data and parsed it into an excel doc. Then using the raw data collected several graphs of data can be sent to a large PDF report.
